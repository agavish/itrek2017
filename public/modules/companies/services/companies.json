It was named \"Best Health App of the Year\" by the Doctors 2.0 organization in June 2015 and has produced significant results in clinical trials on diabetic populations. The platform suits primary and specialty care clinics and payers concerned about escalating treatment cost and low adherence rates.",

Our flagship product, Parasight, identifies, enumerates and speciates malaria more accurately than all other currently used diagnostics. In the future, our platform technology will be used to identify additional anomalies in blood and body fluids.\n\nThe Parasight platform consists of a Scanning and Analyzing Device as well as a Sample Preparation Kit containing custom-built disposable plastic cartridges to create an efficient, standardized and uniform version of the “thin blood smear”, that is easy to prepare within 15 seconds. These cartridges require only a small drop of blood that can be obtained with a finger-stick or from a tube.\n\nSightDx monitors the Parasight status in real-time using an RMS (Remote Management System), and provides quick, customized remote repair and software upgrade services.",

Museums get that and are looking to technology to solve this problem. Young people visiting museums are often experiencing a passive visit detached from the way they live.\n\nMuseloop'saugmented reality gaming platform allows museums to easily create a mobile app for their visitors, allowing museums to focuson the content, while Muselooptakes care of users and engagement. By creating engaging experiences, vast amounts of of quality data on visitors are collected.\n\nThe game-based museum tour experience puts the art at the front and center and uses the games to deliver relevant, interesting and contextual content. Museloopbuilt templates of games and a CMS. Once museums put content in, an app that provides a unique experience can be immediately generated.\n\nTheSaaS platform offers asolution for any exhibition (permanent or temporary) and museum, from the top tier to the long tail of thousands of museums facing the same challenges with no affordable solutions.",
