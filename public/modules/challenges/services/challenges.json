The prospect's pipeline includes several leading companies in the energy, steel-making and agricultural equipment sectors.   The software technology combines machine learning with physical and mathematical concepts.It basically enables the organization to build an additional layer of knowledge about the machine behavior that is blended automatically into the machine learning process. This technology is based on an open standard developed at the Technion in Israel (now ISO 19450).\nToday Precog is focused on predicting failures for industrial machines (chemical, power-gen, Oil&Gas etc). This topic is usually known as predictive maintenance.  We think that the most interesting future market for the company's product is the autonomous car industry.   We know for a fact that the technology will work there: we can predict engine and other parts failures days in advance. We know that cars will be connected and that the data will be available.   We don't know if there is a business case for predictive maintenance for autonomous cars.   The group will need to learn the autonomous car market and evaluate:  1. Is there a value for predictive maintenance in this future market / 2. who is the customer and what is the business case (who owns the car, who operate it, who cares if it breaks unexpectedly...). / 3. What is the business model- software company\\service company. What is the right pricing structure. / 4. Future competition and potential players in the market. / 5. Marketing and Sales strategy and timing - who should be our partners? are they into the topic now? what conferences we should attend? who are the opinion leaders? / 6. build a conceptual budget for penetrating this market.  The results (if the analysis will indicate that this market is attractive) will be used by Precog to apply for government funding for this specific activity.  The group will gain knowledge and expertise in one of the most interesting markets today, a market that attract anyone from Google to Apple and Tesla.",

Veed.me's clients include Fortune 500 companies, as well as earlier stage startups.  \nVeed.me has an office in Tel Aviv and another office in New York City which focuses on sales and business development.    \nBackground to challenge: We founded Veed.me about 4 years ago with the vision of connecting people who needed videos, with a vetted community of videographers around the world.    When we started, we thought our product would fit all sorts of SMBs, including brick and mortar businesses (i.e: little shops, restaurant etc..) because we knew that anyone who has online presence, needs a video.  After 2 years of working on many projects we found the SMB market a challenging space for a number of sreasons:  - They do not have large budgets   - their LTV (life time value) is low  - They are not educated enough about the importance of online video for their marketing efforts.        Accordingly, we have pivoted and re-focused on a different target persona, Marketers.      Marketers have a higher LTV than SMB owners.   -They run marketing campaigns  -They are educated when it comes to the need of video  -They have bigger budgets   Theyre a part of a big community (marketersindustry groupsprofessional associations) where word of mouth can become a useful growth tool for us    BUT -  marketers is a very general term and can include many types of personas (marketers at an early stage startup, marketing agency, VP Marketing at a large organization, and etc.)    \nAfter working with many types of marketers, including: product marketing managers at big companies like Google, Agoda, Facebook etc.. we have narrowed down our dream persona:  The marketing person in the range of later stage startups (100+ employees) all the way to large organizations like Google.    Our approach to working with these types of companies is to treat them as Enterprise Clients and provide White Glove service (see attached deck). This means that they dont solely use the online product, but rather, are assigned a dedicated project manager, who provides a more personalized and hands on service (only using our product to show different creators and examples when needed).    Based on feedback we received, Enterprise Clients like the following elements of our offering:   A - Quick turnarounds  B - Global reach (we have creators everywhere) - great for shooting testimonials or research videos like street interviews etc.  C - One point of contact    Based on these findings, we created this Enterprise page - https:veed.meenterprise    \nOur goal and challenge that we would like the assistance of the students is the following:   \nGOAL: Just like any other business, we would like to create stability and consistency with our revenuedealflow    \nCHALLENGE: We are lacking certainty regarding when and if our clients  will become repreat users.   Currently, each project is being priced individually, and then executed. But we believe our offering should be more intelligent and more clear (or standardized).  \nWe would like the students to develop us a comprehensive pricing model.    Although we are not a SaaS solution and each video is priced differently, we believe that there is a way to create recurring deals with Enterprise Clients for specific (or maybe not specific) types of videos.  If we have that, in addition to knowing what other needs such companies might want as a service, we can build an improved product, that will serve these types of clients.    We would also like the students to research and develop a method for the processes of engaging with enterprises. What are the main barriers of such companies to begin working with a vendor like us. (We do not reffer here to bureaucratic issues like becoming a vendor, but more about budgeting issues, quarterly plans etc.. )   \nAt the end of this research challenge we would like to know what the key elements that Veed.me should be offering enterprises are in terms of:   - Pricing models  - Ideal processes flow   - Ideal contact person (sometimes its not the person who holds the marketing title, but something related or around it)  - Which budgets videos are being taken from (Marketing? Research? Design? etc.)    Optional - preferred deliverables.  These findings will be crucial for our business development mapping and actions  \n",

To date, 3D content creation is a costly, manual and time consuming process, reserved only for professionals using complex software. This is well beyond the reach of many companies seeking to access the AR/VR market.  Hexa addresses this gap by automatically converting low cost 2D images into flexible 3D objects. / Online fashion is thefirst sub vertical that the company has chosen to address. We aim to expand into other online sub verticals early next year (cunsumer electronics, furniture and home design).  Our fashion customers use our platform in order to create a virtual equivalent of their collections and display them in 3D. By doing so, they enhance shoppers engagement with a game like experience which improves key metrics such as conversion rate and time on site. Using 3D we are creating a stable uplift of 93% in our customers mobile conversion rate.  This is minimizing the gap between mobile traffic and mobile conversion which is one of the biggest online problems to date. Hexa is led by technical founders from Kenshoo, IronSource and AlgoTech and is advancing pilots with several global customers including M&S, American Eagle, Nike, River Island, Sears. \nBackground to challenge:\nThe complexity of Hexa's VR platform is not only technological. The most difficult part, that should always come before any development effort, is understanding not only your lowest hanging fruits and their current needs, but building your technology in a way that will be relevant to the market in 5 years time, while using the little resources a seed stage company has. When done correctly,  this can bind business and technology into successful and innovative companies.\nCatering our technology to the ever changing and developing needs of the market is becoming more and more difficult for two main reasons: \na. The platform itself is getting more and more sophisticated and can provide value to an ever growing list of industries. \nb. The VR, AR, 3D printing & 3D content industries are all very young with only one major use case - Gaming (and porn but it's off the table from obvious reasons). Since they are so young, have only one major vertical and the available research is basic, understanding how the old world should tap into its capabilities, requires a rare combination of ingenuity and creativity.\nThe challenge:\nConduct an in depth industry analysis on the VR, AR, 3D printing & 3D content industries and where they will be in 5 years time. Based on your analysis and research findings of where these 4 industries will be in 5 years time, make recommendations on how the company should cater its technology to meet those needs/trends and where we should focus our development efforst. In other words, develop a go-to-market strategy intertwined with product development strategy. (Once you have signed an NDA, we will provide in depth knowledge on our product capabilities to-date). Questions to address in your research include, but are not limited to:  - Who are the companies that will control these industries and what will social VR will look like in such a world. - Will 3D printing change the way we live and how can creating 3D content facilitate it's growth. - When will the gaming industry demand automation for its content creation and will it be possible to use smartphones to immerse our physical world with our virtual world (project Tango). \nThe mapping process is the most crucial part of your research since it will allow you to separate Sci-Fi from real technology (not an easy thing to do these days). Please keep in mind that the answers you are about to provide us will be used in order to build a better platform and focus our efforts on the highest expectancy verticals. It will have a direct effect on the way we prioritize our time and tasks sot has to be bulletproof. \nYou are about to enter a world with no limitation and little boundaries. A world where our childhood movies, dreams and desires are put down to the test and are manufactured by 1 & 0.

Retailers, Media companies and B2C Marketers have adopted the technology rapidly in order to personalize digital experiences across all channels - web, mobile web, mobile app and email.    The problem with personalization today and how Dynamic Yield addresses it:    Personalization is a meta term in the industry used to describe the delivery of individualized experiences across all channels.    The easier way to think about personalization is to think about Amazon.   Amazon, which has set the gold standard for personalization, tailors its website, mobile web and mobile app based on each individuals preferences, both declared as well as inferred.     Personalization has many components or strategies.  For example, when a customer visits a website, they expect the following:    That the site will tailor the first experience based on knowledge about where they come from (location, weather conditions).   And also based on the their past behavior on the site.   This requires that a vast amount of data from disparate systems to be brought together in order to create a complete picture of the customer.    Many aspects of the site can be tailored or personalized.   For example, the home page, the product pages, the check-out cart experience,  the content delivered, the products recommended, the messages that are delivered etc.    There are a variety of individual point solutions that address each individual aspect of personalization.  So, it is not uncommon for a retailer to Vendor A to deliver product recommendations and Vendor B to deliver personalized 1:1 messages.  Because customers are using individual point solutions,  the overall experience delivered to the end-user is disjointed.  Dynamic Yield addresses this problem by offering a single unified customer engagement hub which collects all available information and makes it really easy for the marketer to build, test and deliver individualized experiences.     \n\nThe challenge:    Today, personalization solutions are bought and executed by the Marketing teams.   So, the VP of Marketing, the CMO, the Chief Digital Officer and the VP of Merchandising are the typical business executives who seek, and implement personalization solutions.     \n# 1:  Change in who buys personalization solutions:  We, at Dynamic Yield, are foreseeing a seismic shift in the buyers who actually buy customer solutions.  Specifically, we believe that the adoption of a personalization solution will move away from the Marketing function and towards the Technology & Product Management function.    Simply put, the new buyers of personalization technologies will be the CIO, CTOs and VPs of Product Management.   \n# 2.  Build vs. Buy:  We, at Dynamic Yield, also anticipate that more and more companies will want to control their destiny when it comes to personalization.  So, instead of buying a 3rd party solution like ours, they will actually build various components of personalization in-house.   In the process of building such a solution, they will look for solution providers who provide APIs (Application Programming Interface) that actually breaks down the process of personalization to individual components and makes it easy for them to build personalization engines internally, on their own stack.    For example, a company might decide to:  Use an API that makes it really easy to collect all the data that a user generates on their site.   They will then take this data and incorporate it into their internal systems to develop a unified picture of the customer.    Using an API that gives them access to machine learning algorithms that make it easy for them to deliver the right product, content or offer to any user irrespective of their channel.    \nThe Assignment:    We would like to specifically understand:    What is the market opportunity for an API-led personalization initiative?  What percentage of the market is interested in a solution like this vs. the current approach of using a 3rd party vendor to manage personalization.    Who are the successful companies that have built and marketed APIs successfully.  What are the best practices in taking an API led solution to market? How does the marketing mix change and what are the channels to reach product managers and developers with APIs around personalization.     What does the market need in terms of Personalization APIs. What are the components of personalization that are most likely to be in-housed?  This, in turn, will determine our product strategy around the APIs we should build.  \n",

						"Convexum is developing a pioneering solution for eliminating the rising threat of uncontrolled or malicious use of commercial drones.    The growing popularity of low cost commercial drones has exposed new and immense vulnerabilities in airborne , tactical perimeter security, and securing VIPs and mass gatherings, that is hard to tackle using classical anti-aircraft systems.    Investing our vast experience with reverse engineering, telemetry protocols and RF mitigation and interception, we are developing a fully automated terrestrial solution for detection, danger assessment, and safe landing in a remote location of commercial drones using innovative cyber techniques and free from warfare or RF jamming methods. ",
						"1. Analyzing a brand new market.",
						"As the counter-drone market - especially its civilian aspects - is an entirely new market, there is limited information and analysis that can be leveraged by us. Known potential verticals to consider include: airports, prisons, hospital (helipads), critical infrastructure, oil & gas, sports venues, IT datacenters, campus (enterprise, gov't) security, Hollywood movie lots, fire-fighting scenes. The challenge includes the following topics:",
						" * Market size estimation (TAM or yearly) with growth potential",
						" * Revealing more verticals with their relevant scenarios (privacy, smuggling, public safety and more) ",
						" * Pointing out the verticals that are experiencing the biggest pain at the moment. ",
						" * What are the legal barriers in drones mitigation using cyber means if any? ",
						" * What is the extent of measures government entities are allowed to enforce on rogue drones flying in sensitive sites? airports? prisons? which perimeters are allowed to legally mitigate drones? ",
						" * What is the extent of measures private entities - such that are not regulated under HLS or FAA rules - are allowed to enforce on rogue drones? ",
						" * What legislative measures are being taken by the federal and/or state-level governments or are planned for the coming years? ",
						"2. Pricing and Business model. ",
						"Taking into account the industry and regulatory analysis conducted, how much will a potential customer be willing to pay in order to keep drones out of a perimeter? What are the potential business models that can work well and what is the optimal one? Prices need to take into consideration the integrator markup (as in physical security installations, which are the ones usually doing the installation and on-site maintenance)."

We operate in pharmaceutical markets worldwide, with a significant presence in the United States, Europe and other markets. As a world leading pharmaceutical company, we are strategically positioned to benefit from ongoing changes in the global healthcare environment.   \nWe operate our business in two segments:    \n    Generic medicines, which include chemical and therapeutic equivalents of originator medicines in a variety of dosage forms, including tablets, capsules, injectables, inhalants, liquids, ointments and creams. We are the leading generic drug company in the United States and Europe, and we have a significant or growing presence in our ROW markets. We are also one of the worlds leading manufacturers of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs).    \n    Specialty medicines, which include several franchises, most significantly our core therapeutic areas of CNS medicines such as Copaxone, Azilect, Nuvigil and Zecuity and of respiratory medicines such as ProAir HFA and QVAR. Our specialty medicines segment includes other therapeutic areas, such as oncology medicines, including Treanda, womens health and selected other areas.      \nIn addition to these two segments, we have other activities, primarily PGT Healthcare, our over-the-counter (OTC) consumer healthcare joint venture with P&G.   We seek to address unmet patient needs while capitalizing on evolving market, economic and legislative dynamics in global healthcare. These dynamics include the aging population, increased spending on pharmaceuticals in emerging markets, economic pressure on governments and private payors to provide accessible healthcare solutions, legislative and regulatory reforms, an increase in patient awareness and the growing importance of OTC medicines.   \nIntegrating Home Monitoring and diagnostic solutions into the Teva business model:  Teva has been undergoing a strategic transformation to become a leading innovator in the pharmaceutical industry, extending its reach beyond developing and commercializing specialty and generic drugs, to providing holistic disease management solution for our customers.  As part of this effort, Tevas Diagnostics and Personalized Medicine (DPM) group is actively seeking to develop or partner with solutions that enable the tailoring of treatment to the individual needs, characteristics and preferences of our customers.    To that extent, several home based diagnostics and monitoring systems (HBDMS) are assessed for synergy identification. An example of such technologies can be found in Cue.  In contrast to Companion Diagnostics, where a biomarker identifies patients who are likely to respond to a specific drug developed by a specific company, HBDMS are currently designed to measure markers that are not necessarily specific to a certain drug, but rather help the customer better manage their health.  While the business model for investing in the development of companion diagnostics and partnering on their commercialization is clear (due to the direct link to a specific drug), the business model for collaborating with HBDMS is not.  Due to the high value these solutions are perceived to bring to our customers in the future, and given that Teva has the largest medicine cabinet in the world, and is currently treating 205 million patients each day, DPM would like to identify a viable business model where HBDMS are integrated into the overall Teva offering.   Business challenge:  Identify a business model that will allow Teva to incorporate HBDMS into its commercial activities in a way that will generate stickiness to Tevas products, and give us a sustained differentiated value proposition to our customers (patients, physicians, payers). \nSome questions and points to help guide you along the way:  \n- Understand the traditional Pharmaceutical industry's value chain and business model  \n- Understand the \"winds of change\" in this industry, key competitors, and new players entering the space  - Understand Teva (Therapeutic areas of interest, breadth of commercial capabilities and activities: OTC, Generics, PGT, Specialty, who are our customers, and the company's transformation process)  \n- Why, and how does Teva see potential to disrupt the current model?  \n- How can HBDMS fit in to the equation? \n - How can HBDMS offer our customers  a differentiated value proposition \n - Keep in mind that due to anti-kickback and inducement to prescribe regulations, Teva cannot provide the devices free of charge to  physicians or patients  \n- Tevas current strategy does include selling devices to end users (this does not mean, that given an appealing business model that this will not change)  \n- View the HBMDS solutions as a platform that can be customized rather than a locked product.     \n",

						"Identify a business model that will allow Teva to incorporate HBDMS into its commercial activities in a way that will generate 'stickiness' to Tevaâ€™s products, and give us a sustained differentiated value proposition to our customers (patients, physicians, payers). Some questions and points to help guide you along the way:",
						" - Understand the traditional Pharmaceutical industry's value chain and business model",
						" - Understand the 'winds of change' in this industry, key competitors, and new players entering the space",
						" - Understand Teva (Therapeutic areas of interest, breadth of commercial capabilities and activities: OTC, Generics, PGT, Specialty, who are our customers, and the company's transformation process) ",
						" - Why, and how does Teva see potential to disrupt the current model? ",
						" - How can HBDMS fit in to the equation? ",
						"  - How can HBDMS offer our customers  a differentiated value proposition",
						"  - Keep in mind that due to anti-kickback and inducement to prescribe regulations, Teva cannot provide the devices free of charge to  physicians or patients",
						" - Tevaâ€™s current strategy does include selling devices to end users (this does not mean, that given an appealing business model that this will not change)",
						" - View the HBMDS solutions as a platform that can be customized rather than a locked product."

It is extremely simple to use, is inexpensive because it requires no capital expenditure, and is no-risk because it is a pay-as-you-save solution. \nCropX underlying concept is based on the fact that land is not uniform, it is not completely flat and its soil structure is never uniform across a field. Virtually all current irrigation systems irrigate fields uniformly, thereby over-irrigating parts of a field and under-irrigating other parts; manually planning differential irrigation is not practical as it is highly complex, time consuming and requires expensive hardware investment. CropX is the worlds first solution that automates this process: it analyzes the field, and then automatically determines and applies daily just the right amount of irrigation to different parts of the same field. Our technology has been validated and demonstrating up to 30% water and energy savings and corresponding crop-yield enhancement, and has been published in multiple peer-reviewed publications. It is protected by robust intellectual property: our system is the worlds first and only solution that automates differential irrigation, and central elements enabling this automation are protected by our broad patent applications. \nFor the farmer our solution is revolutionary in its simplicity. The farmer simply downloads our app, places our sensors in the field in  Do It Yourself method, guided by the app. The sensors then communicate with the internet cloud, which performs power computing and generates a daily irrigation map and recommendations. The farmer reviews the planned irrigation on his smartphone, and modify it as needed. Once confirmed, our system sends the irrigation map to the irrigator, continuing to monitor its execution.\nCropXs business model is two pronged: (a) generating strong subscription revenues from its tiered software-as-service offerings, and (b) leveraging our access to massive agricultural data to create longterm value using additional sources fo information.

We can even alert the retailer that there are few items at the front (facing) of the shelf & that stock needs to be replenished. \nAnother topic is planogram compliance: The shelf area is the most valuable resource of the retailer & too many mistakes occur due to human error. We use colored LEDs at the front of the shelf to indicate the correct planogram to the store employees, so they can replenish the shelf according to the updated planogram. / Our mission is to use the store shelf as a platform for interacting with employees/customers in a variety of use cases:  Logistics & operation, Marketing & promotions, and creating valuable data that can be used by suppliers. Our solution is composed of two elements: Hardware -A modular, wireless IoT Shelf appliance that collects light sensor values and transmits via Wi-Fi  to the cloud. SW- a cloud based application that analyzes the data sent from the shelf and sends Real-Time alerts, recommendations & statistics to Retailers and suppliers. The shelf & the cloud are connected allowing a comprehensive set of interactive applications. \nPlease look at:   https://youtu.be/B9O02F4Hcfs \nOur first priority is to identify who our customer is: When we started, it was clear that the Tier 1 retailers (Target, Walmart & others) are the target. We later realized that the CGP suppliers have a similar incentive at minimum & they may be the ones paying for the system. So: is there one customer? two? a mix? / What is the ROI model for the retailers? the suppliers? / Can we charge extra for additional features such as better compliance to shelf planogram, better awareness to sales (flashing lights)? Can we sell the data we produce? / What is the ideal business model?  \nWe are an early stage startup , that has not started sales efforts yet. The basic commercial model we had in mind was recurrent revenues based on charging the Retailer one USD per product type (sku) per month. The logic behind this is: A typical grocery product costs ~$3 to $4 each. The retailers make gross profit of 25% to 30% which is ~$1. Therefore,  if the retailer is able to not lose the sale of only one item during the whole month, he covers his investment. On the other hand, various people claim that this means ~$4 to $5 per shelf per month, which is a lot of money for the retailer. They suggest that the CPG suppliers will put it at their charge in stores, agreeing with the retailer to act immideately as they get alerts.  So far we did not start selling the system; we only spoke with both retailers & suppliers & they both expressed an interest in trialing the system.\nImportant readings: \nhttp://www.nacds.org/pdfs/membership/out_of_stock.pdf http://www.acceleratedanalytics.com/blog/2012/2/6/calculating-the-cost-of-out-of-stocks.html http://www.businessinsider.com/r-new-target-coos-headache-too-few-goods-to-keep-shelves-filled-2015-8 \nhttp://mmibrands.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/True-Cost-of-Resets-Remodels-and-Other-Planogram-Changes.pdf \nhttps://www.thebalance.com/retail-planograms-2890336 / \nhttp://ca1.qualtrics.com/WRQualtricsControlPanel/File.php?Filename=conversion-stdy__mpaper.pdf&Size=2262933&Type=application%2Fpdf&F=F_3L5spcEfbRYrDFJ\n",

SW- a cloud based application that analyzes the data sent from the shelf and sends Real-Time alerts, recommendations & statistics to Retailers and suppliers. The shelf & the cloud are connected allowing a comprehensive set of interactive applications. ",
						"Please look at:   https://youtu.be/B9O02F4Hcfs ",
						"Our first priority is to identify who our customer is: When we started, it was clear that the Tier 1 retailers (Target, Walmart & others) are the target. We later realized that the CGP suppliers have a similar incentive at minimum & they may be the ones paying for the system. So: is there one customer? two? a mix? / What is the ROI model for the retailers? the suppliers? / Can we charge extra for additional features such as better compliance to shelf planogram, better awareness to sales (flashing lights)? Can we sell the data we produce? / What is the ideal business model?  ",
						"We are an early stage startup , that has not started sales efforts yet. The basic commercial model we had in mind was recurrent revenues based on charging the Retailer one USD per product type (sku) per month. The logic behind this is: A typical grocery product costs ~$3 to $4 each. The retailers make gross profit of 25% to 30% which is ~$1. Therefore,  if the retailer is able to not lose the sale of only one item during the whole month, he covers his investment. On the other hand, various people claim that this means ~$4 to $5 per shelf per month, which is a lot of money for the retailer. They suggest that the CPG suppliers will put it at their charge in stores, agreeing with the retailer to act immideately as they get alerts.  So far we did not start selling the system; we only spoke with both retailers & suppliers & they both expressed an interest in trialing the system.",

					"longDescription": "\nBeyon3D LTD.  \nFounded in Israel in 2011, Beyon3D is a leading a multidisciplinary building technology company, whose R&D team consists of mechanical engineers, aerospace engineers, material scientists, chemists, physicists, programmers, algorithmic developers, prototyping experts and architects. In November 2013 the Beyon3D team set out in its task to design and develop a new age robotic manufacturing system for the building industry.    Beyon3D aims to disrupt this multi-billion dollars - yet inefficient - construction market by introducing the first industry specific robotic manufacturing system, which enables a complete solution from design to manufacturing of building products: in simple or complex forms, in larger scale, in higher quality, in reduced cost and manufacturing time, eliminating the inefficiencies caused by common construction methods and human error, making existing prefabricated production lines and standard building processes on site obsolete.    Beyon3D brings the industrial robotics revolution to the construction market. Using a fully automatic robotic process, Beyon3D turns any 2D drawing or 3D model files into pre-fabricated building components, reaching micron-level precision at unprecedented production speeds, and at a fraction of the cost, compared to traditional methods.    Combining a specially designed proprietary software, tailor made materials, and a specially adapted 6 axis robotic arms, with its own unique hardware extensions, Beyon3D has developed an end-to-end file-to-manufacturing process that doesnt require any coding or technical background, resulting in a fully automated process and zero manual labor. The process is simple, intuitive, and fast - a digital file of the component is uploaded to the system, and within seconds transformed into specific tasks for the robot. Using our own custom made building materials, the robot fabricates the component, while combining subtractive and additive manufacturing techniques.     With Beyon3D, developers, contractors, and manufacturers can dramatically reduce manufacturing costs, eliminate production errors, reduce waste, increase production output, and, for the first time, support any client custom requirement, including highly complex geometries.    \n\nThe Challenge  \nIn his book The Innovators Dilemma, Clayton Christensen made critical observations about established companies that lose significant market share to entrants with disruptive technology. However, most of the evidence indicates that it is a long and difficult process for superior new technologies to replace (or disrupt) the existing technological status quo.     Following 4 year of R&D, Beyon3D has completed its breakthrough technology and it is now in its final phases of implementation and beta testing. \n\nFurthermore, the company has already established a number of strategic partnerships with large market players with the intent to implement the technology in the following couple of years, starting 2017. Therefore, it is within this context that the students will support the company as it embarks in a preparation for a worldwide launch.  The students will develop a viable market penetration strategy that would leverage the company into a leadership position. In addition to the development of a strategic approach towards a successful market penetration and increasing brand equity, the students will identify the current market conditions and dynamics through a comprehensive breakdown of all forces affecting the sector:    1. Market Data analysis  - Market ecosystem  - Market leaders  - Spectrum of products, US market   - Products pricing   - Competitor business models  2. Go to Market Strategy  - Choice of initial products to be introduced to the market  - Business model and Pricing  - Strategic Partnership opportunities  - Process of production and lunching new products (in-house manufacturing/synergies & joint venturesB2B technology and materials direct sales)  - Development of US brand identity  \n\nBackground information:\nGlobal manufacturing companies spend millions of dollars on research, design and development of new technologies and products. The manufacturing industry is an innovation leader in terms of R&D and patents. These investments have resulted in rapid growth of new industries and manufacturing capabilities.   Despite its great potential innovation and cutting-edge are not words frequently associated with the construction & infrastructure industry, at least not in comparison to high tech industries, but even more unfortunate is that the industrys poor image may be deserved. Data from analysts shows that the construction industry productivity has a long history of decline that continues today. While most other industries have undergone tremendous changes over the last few decades, the Construction & Infrastructure sector has been hesitant about fully embracing the latest technological opportunities, and its labor productivity has declined accordingly.     Perhaps the most acute problem in this sector is the traditional onsite work, which occupies the majority of the building construction process; workers still measure, produce, shape and assemble elements manually. Therefore, this longtime laboring process between design drawings and physical building still remains extremely inefficient.  A research conducted by Ghery Technologies (Leading building Technology company) estimated that within the global construction there is a lack of efficiency in the building process; 10% Materials are wasted, 30% of construction is reworked, 40% of the manpower is unproductive on job sites, 90% of projects are over budget, 40% of projects are late, leading to an additional 20% cost of the project production. The research concludes that contracting firms lose close to 45% of profits on write-offs that result from poor project performance. In the US market alone $15.8 billion is lost due to these inefficiencies.    To overcome these losses and waste, we are witnessing a global shift towards the industrialization and customization of this sector, with the implementation of advance technologies. Furthermore, many firms are focusing on the implementation of new technologies because of their belief in its potential to increase their revenues and to strengthen their competitive advantage. According to Deloitte & Touches Mid-Market Perspectives: America's Economic Engine report, technology has superseded talent acquisition in middle market firms with 70% executives surveyed saying that their productivity has increased due to improved business processes and technology developments. Firms that are unable to offer these concepts to owners are and will be at extreme disadvantage.  In addition to technology, another trend which is helping the sector to reduce waste and inefficiencies is the movement towards offsite construction. The principal behind this trend is the manufacturing and prefabrication of building components in a factory. After the completion of the manufacturing process, the components are transported to the site for a quicker building erection with skilled labor force.   In McGraw-Hill Construction latest survey report, Prefabrication and Modularization: Increasing Productivity in the Construction Industry, out of over 800 architecture, engineering and contracting (AEC) professionals, 66% report improved project schedules, 65% report decreased project costs, and 77% report reduced construction site waste.  When exploring the prefabrication of custom made building products, the Precast Concrete Product Manufacturing Industry is one of the most influential industries in the building sector. This industry comprises firms engaged in manufacturing concrete products. Industry production includes a broad range of products such as precast concrete slabs and panels, building boards, concrete roofing tiles, concrete railroad ties, concrete posts and poles, pre-stressed concrete beams and trusses, and ornamental concrete products. However, in this off-site construction industry building components are still produced through standard manufacturing processes, and therefore a limited spectrum of products is provided for those who wish to build faster, cheaper and more efficient.    Enter robotics period. The automotive, aerospace and ship building industries have gained an extensive knowledge in digital manufacturing techniques along the years in order to keep a competitive advantage within their market, reduce costs and increase desirability of products in terms of design and quality. These markets have been using industrial robots since 1970's. However, this technology and its following benefits have not been embraced in the construction industry. This may be due to the slower pace of the construction industry tends to adopt technological innovations in general.    \n\n",

This unique and highly disruptive solution uses an electro-optic scanning device placed at strategic locations such as depot or parking lot gates, gas stations and toll roads to automatically inspect passing vehicles for tire and wheel problems.  / Using Neomatixs solution helps fleet operators to significantly improve their bottom line, safety, up time (the KPI that checks when an asset, such as a truck or bus, is available for work, as opposed to down time when that vehicle is broken down, in the shop, undergoing scheduled maintenance etc.) and carbon footprint by automatically monitoring tires and diagnosing issues such as under inflation, wear, tear, foreign objects, asymmetry, over heating, wheel alignment and more. Our solution can even detect stolen and incompatible tires without installing any component on the vehicle or tires, and avoiding any disturbance to the work routine. \nThe company is active in Brazil, where it currently has 1 big paying customer, and a distribution agreement with a fleet management company. We are in the process of closing a pilot deal with Coca-Cola this month, plan to open a Bizdev office in the US before the end of the year and have recently been selected by Shell Oil as 1 of the top 5 mobility startups in 2016, meaning we will enter Shells startup program next year.\nThe basic business model is selling hardware gate scanners (roughly for $15K) and charging a monthly license fee for the tire management software (~$5/month per truck). Leasing options are also available for long term contracts (no upfront fee, slightly higher recurring fees).\n\nThe first part of the challenge is understanding the industry trends and competitive landscape. Start by defining the Pain and Total Addressable Market - Namely, what is the importance of proper tire maintenance, how much do fleets pay due to tire negligence, and what other solutions exist for fleet-level tire management and monitoring. Conduct a SWOT analysis - noting competition, trend and regulation. / Neomatix is currently focused on commercial vehicle fleets in the US, so the challenge is to create a go to market plan. / Start by understanding the product - its features and differentiation. / Identify the competition and the company's competitive edge. / Which potential customers are more likely to enjoy this disruptive solution? Can you name several? How big are they? How do you make a sales deal? What is the cost of acquisition?   This go to market plan should be part of a  strategy for the next 2 years in the US market. Which customers should we focus on? Why? How do we pitch them? How do we prove the value of an innovative and disruptive technology? What pricing/financing model would you suggest? Why?

						"Using Neomatixâ€™s solution helps fleet operators to significantly improve their bottom line, safety, up time (the KPI that checks when an asset, such as a truck or bus, is available for work, as opposed to â€˜down timeâ€™ when that vehicle is broken down, in the shop, undergoing scheduled maintenance etc.) and carbon footprint by automatically monitoring tires and diagnosing issues such as under inflation, wear, tear, foreign objects, asymmetry, over-heating, wheel alignment and more. Our solution can even detect stolen and incompatible tires without installing any component on the vehicle or tires, and avoiding any disturbance to the work routine.",
						"The company is active in Brazil, where it currently has 1 big paying customer, and a distribution agreement with a fleet management company. We are in the process of closing a pilot deal with Coca-Cola this month, plan to open a Bizdev office in the US before the end of the year and have recently been selected by Shell Oil as 1 of the top 5 mobility startups in 2016, meaning we will enter Shellâ€™s startup program next year.",
						"The basic business model is selling hardware gate scanners (roughly for $15K) and charging a monthly license fee for the tire management software (~$5/month per truck). Leasing options are also available for long term contracts (no upfront fee, slightly higher recurring fees).",
						"The first part of the challenge is understanding the industry trends and competitive landscape.",
						" - Start by defining the Pain and Total Addressable Market; Namely, what is the importance of proper tire maintenance, how much do fleets pay due to tire negligence, and what other solutions exist for fleet-level tire management and monitoring. ",
						" - Conduct a SWOT analysis - noting competition, trend and regulation. ",
						"Neomatix is currently focused on commercial vehicle fleets in the US, so the second part of the challenge is to create a go to market plan.",
						" - Start by understanding the product - its features and differentiation. ",
						" - Identify the competition and the company's competitive edge. ",
						" - Which potential customers are more likely to enjoy this disruptive solution? Can you name several? How big are they? How do you make a sales deal? What is the cost of acquisition? ",
						"This go to market plan should be part of a strategy for the next 2 years in the US market. Which customers should we focus on? Why? How do we pitch them? How do we prove the value of an innovative and disruptive technology? What pricing/financing model would you suggest? Why? How do we handle stronger and better financed competitors?"

Genoox developed a proprietary data structure, able to index genomic data more efficiently, saving more than 90% of the data space consumed, Genoox provides increased accuracy in structural variants anomaly detection, linking patterns and data. In addition, Genoox infrastructure allows conducting massive genes wide associations studies utilizing intuitive tools more efficiently.    2.

Due to long sales cycles with these very large enterprises, SecBI is looking for alternative options in market penetration, and the SMB market is one of them. Specifically, enterprises with ~20,000-80,000 employees.  These customers should have faster sales cycles, and possibly higher needs, due to lower budgets for Cyber Security services and experts. \nSecBIs challenge, is to understand the attractiveness of SecBIs product, for SMB organizations, specifically, organizations with over $1B in revenues (approximately F2,000). Analyze the competitive landscape, the biz logig etc.  These organizations would have security systems deployed, a security team, and this team probably faces the challenges SecBI solves.  As part of the challenge, SecBI would like the following (or similar) questions to be addressed through directly engaging with relevant SMBs:\n1. Do you face the problem described by SecBI?\n2. Are you looking for solution for this problem in 2017?\n3. How much would you pay for a system that would solve this problem?\nBased on your research, develop a market penetration plan.

Intensix utilizes high volume and high velocity analytics to identify real-time patterns in physiological data that predict a deterioration in the patients condition. By providing clinicians with early prediction of deteriorations, clinicians will be able to intervene sooner and consequently prevent unnecessary complications, reduce mortality and ultimately, save lives. Deployed as a standalone app or integrated into an existing solution, the platform harnesses the vast amount of available ICU data to deliver highly accurate predictive clinical analytics that provide hospital management and medical personnel with the preemptive information they require to better manage the ICU floor. The Intensix solution is expected to reduce the average length of stay, a benefit that directly lowers the hospitals costs and frees up revenue-producing ICU beds for other patients.\nIntensix provides decision support tool for early predictions of deterioration in critical care and high acuity areas at the hospital.     Since our inception on January 2015, our development team that consists of top notch researchers and mathematicians, devoted themselves to data ingestion, developing a knowledge system and building the prediction algorithms. As part of our R&D efforts, we completed 3 successful retrospective studies and are now in the middle of prospective, live, proof concept trials at Mayo Clinic and Tel Aviv Medical Center.

					"longDescription": "Overview-\nRethink the way we drink!\nOur Vision- Our vision is to change the way people consume water while they are on the go to sustainable and eco-friendly way!\nAs public drinking fountains are no longer perceived as a high quality, clean water source- both bottled water and sugary beverages consumption are constantly increasing. The disadvantages are clear: we drink less water due to its price, polluting the environment tremendously and harm our bodies with sugary beverages. \nThe solution: Offering the public a true alternative- equal by quality and affordable by price. In one word: Woosh!\nWoosh smart water stations are designed to provide a high volume of chilled, pure and great tasting water in public spaces. Combined with first of its kind bottle cleaning system to rinse personal bottles and ongoing meticulous maintenance, Woosh stations offer a genuine alternative to bottled water. A network of stations will make cool, high quality water accessible to the public in a fraction of a price.\n\nThe product- One of its kind smart water station that both fills and rinses any reusable bottle. The station is fully computerized and operates using a touch screen with multiple language modes enabling tourists and local residents to use it easily. In addition, it tracks member's water consumption and calculate how many plastic bottles a single member, as well was the whole Woosh community, has saved so far! There are three types of stations: Mobile, Outdoor and Indoor. Have we mentioned the award winning design?\nFoundation- Our story begins with Itay (co-founder and CEO of woosh), who went out for a stroll with his first born on a sunny summer day. The water bottle they brought from home was long ago finished, and his son was thirsty, so Itay set out looking for a place to fill it up.\nHe searched for a clean and safe source of water, preferably cold, but couldnt find one. Buying a disposable plastic bottle was completely out of the question (call him green if you will). Thats when it hit him, the idea for safe, reliable, plastic free water on the go.\nThe seed for Woosh was planted that day... and the company was thus founded in 2010.\nExperience- Woosh stations had a successful pilot in The City of Tel Aviv, Israel! Our current ongoing projects are station network at Sinclair community college (Dayton) and City of Miami Beach! As a young and constantly evolving company, we are open to new ideas- and YOUR new ideas might take shape at one of our ongoing projects!\n\nThe Challenge: \nA) Miami Beach Challenge (B2C)\nWoosh challenges Cornell's students to create a marketing plan for Woosh that will be deployed in Miami Beach in early 2017! Can you cause the entire city to develop new drinking habits? Can you sell not only a product, but a way of life? \nRequirements- You are in charge of our upcoming launch in Miami Beach! The marketing plan must include a cohesive promotion concept for the network based on thorough market analysis you will perform. Your final product would be a ready to execute A-Z marketing plan, which includes marketing strategy, the promotional messages, and marketing channels. \nTargets- The plan's targets:\n Raise awareness about the project- the entire city should know who we are!  \n Attract as many users as possible to the stations.\n Encourage residents to subscribe to our membership program.\n Establish a habit, not just a fad.\nYour market- You are targeting millions of tourists of diverse nationalities, 91,700 permanent residents and thousands of seasonal residents. By marketing analysis you will perform, you will decide which segments (age? Origin? Pedestrians? Unprofessional athletes? etc.) hold most potential to be future consumers and adjust the marketing program to them. \nChallenges-\n Tourists  How will we reach this constantly changing audience that embodies huge financial potential (7,238,000 overnight visitors!), not only on launch week? \n Seasonal Residents- this group of 23,801 potential members of the ever evolving Woosh community are seasonal resident. How will you convince them to subscribe?\n Additional sales- Woosh sells reusable bottles and provides its members a Woosh Tag with which they can use at the stations. Where and how will we sell them?\n Creativity- Demonstrate creativity! We are looking for non-conventional ideas, surprise us!\nCompetitive landscape  Kiosks, vending machines, convenience stores and any other business selling bottled beverages (up to 1.5 liters) on the go. \n_Please note: The marketing plan must not include negative messages regarding tap water, as Woosh would not like to encourage the use of bottled water and multipacks at home- carbon emissions will multiply!\n",

						"Understanding what's going on in other companies is something we care about and find useful every day. We change jobs, we envy our friends who work there, sometimes weâ€™re just curious. At work, we need to partner with other companies and if we get rich enough, we sometimes invest in other companies. Every time such an event takes place, we need to make up our opinion about a company. The opinion is a result of facts we gather, analysis we conduct and, perhaps most importantly, emotions we feel. ",
						"There are a myriad of reasons that on any given day we might need to discover whatâ€™s going on in other companies.  When weâ€™re thinking about changing jobs, or envying our friendâ€™s new job, or just curious about a company we read about in the news, we get to 'googling'.  Even more critical, sometimes our jobs require us to partner with other companies or, if we get rich enough in this life, we may even be looking to invest in said companies.  Regardless of the case, we are looking to learn and formulate an opinion about one or more companies and this opinion will need to be the result of the facts we gather, subsequent analysis and, perhaps most importantly, the gut feeling we get. ",
						"But going through this process with every company we may need to know about can be very time consuming. More importantly, we have a tendency to miss a thing or two, and this can cause us to draw conclusions that can vary from slightly inaccurate to wildly wrong. Our judgement can get skewed as our information sources are only limited slightly less than our time. ",
						"One would assume that people who do this as a full time job know more. Investors, Business Developers, Product Managers, Journalists, HR Execs, surely they must know so much more about companies and how to craft an opinion about them. And itâ€™s true, they do.  But they face a similar problem, only on a much larger scale. If 'regular' people need to learn about 2-3 companies per month, people who analyze companies for a living need to know much more, and about 2-3 companies per day. Quite a task. ",
						"And so thatâ€™s why the market has created tools. Or at least it has been trying to create tools. Now, Iâ€™ve been using these tools for almost 20 years. Do they leave something to be desired? Often. Are they helpful? Hardly. This is why we created what we call a 'Spotlight Report'. The report is a very simple, personally structured piece, composed using 3 elements: ",

						"2. Analysis - by a network of over 450 experts. This ensures the data is as insightful as possible. ",
						"3. Commentary - produced by dedicated researchers and written personally for you, addressing your areas of interest. ",
						"We worked really hard on this too, made it really efficient, so you can get it for every company in 24-48 hours. And it looks something like this: add a print screen of a report + a print screen of a commentary email. ",
						"Importantly, for the next few days itâ€™s absolutely free. After that, new users will receive introduction credits and, no matter what, we will never force a subscription or make it obscenely expensive. Thatâ€™s a promise. ",
						"Hereâ€™s how you use it: ",
						"Go to www.zirra.com",
						"Search for the company you want to know about",
						"Tell us what exactly you need to know",
						"Automatically generate a personal promo code",
						"Submit order",
						"Receive report and enjoy! ",
						" ",
						"Challenge:",
						"Our challenge is to bring our product to market. Within this challenge, we need to understand: ",
						"1. Exact profile of our intended users - VC, PE firms, Corporate Execs, Others ",
						"2. Seniority level of our intended users - CXO, VP, Director, etc. ",
						"3. Pricing and Packaging ",
						"4. Promotion Tactics",
						"5. Guerilla Marketing (e.g. market through Job Seekers?) ",
						"6. Copywriting and Advertising. ",
						"In other words - our challenge is with nailing the product market fit right. It is an extremely interesting challenge as our product is, in many ways, what our customers already do as a significant part of their job description, only not efficiently. Therefore there is a mind game (and a lot of game theory tactics). Our goal would be to create an independent, singled out and well branded positioning vs: 1. CB Insights / 2. MatterMark / 3. GLG Consulting Group / 4. CrunchBase."
